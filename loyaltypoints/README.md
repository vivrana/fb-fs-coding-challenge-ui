# About

This is the server to handle Loyalty Points of a set of users.  Currently, the app relies on
a static number of users having ID 1 and 2, with points 100 and 50 respectively.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 3.3

* Setup:
  * Install the latest version of Ruby (3.3 as of Jan 11) by following the guide at https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/.
    * In summary: you can use a package manager like `brew` on MacOS or `asdf` and install Ruby.
    * Heads up, depending on your package manager, you may need to add newly installed ruby to your path
      (e.g. echo `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`).  Followed by starting a new terminal session.
  * You may need to install bundler: `gem install bundler`
  * from the `loyaltypoints` directory, run `bundle install`
